  The Vault policies to use when requesting a token for a job, separated by newlines. If left empty,
  this will use all policies from the configured authentication. This is useful for
  AppRole authentication where the AppRole can have many policies attached it and divide
  up the policies per job based on the job folder or name. This allows you to restrict access on
  specific jobs or folders. Each policy can use the following tokens to templatize the policies:
  <ul>
    <li>${job_base_name} - equal to the JOB_BASE_NAME env var</li>
    <li>${job_name} - equal to the JOB_NAME env var</li>
    <li>${job_name_us} - same as ${job_name} with slashes converted to underscores</li>
    <li>${job_folder} - the folder of the job (JOB_NAME - JOB_BASE_NAME without the trailing slash)</li>
    <li>${job_folder_us} - same as ${job_folder} with slashes converted to underscores</li>
    <li>${node_name} - equal to the NODE_NAME env var</li>
  </ul>

  For example, a policy list such as:
  <ul>
    <li>pol_jenkins_base</li>
    <li>pol_jenkins_job_base_${job_base_name}</li>
    <li>pol_jenkins_folder_us_${job_name_folder_us}</li>
    <li>pol_jenkins/folder/${job_folder}</li>
    <li>pol_jenkins_job_us_${job_name_us}</li>
    <li>pol_jenkins/job/${job_name}</li>
  </ul>

  Would result in six policies being applied to each job run. If the JOB_NAME was
  "folder1/folder2/job1" and the JOB_BASE_NAME was "job1", the policies applied would be:
  <ul>
    <li>pol_jenkins_base</li>
    <li>pol_jenkins_job_base_job1</li>
    <li>pol_jenkins_folder_us_folder1_folder2</li>
    <li>pol_jenkins/folder/folder1/folder2</li>
    <li>pol_jenkins_job_us_folder1_folder2_job1</li>
    <li>pol_jenkins/job/folder1/folder2/job1</li>
  </ul>

  Please note that the AppRole should have all policies configured as token_policies and not
  identity_policies, as job-specific tokens inherit all identity_policies automatically.
