<div>
  The path to a java keystore containing CA certs required to validate an SSL connection to your
  vault instance. Defaults to the trust store for your JRE, which is usually a symlink to a
  systemwide keystore, so if you aren't using a self-signed cert or you've already added that cert
  to the system keystore you don't need to change this value.<br/>
  See <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E19509-01/820-3503/6nf1il6er/index.html">here</a>
  for more information about creating a java trust store.
